Sample input is given in [input.txt](https://github.com/asif31iqbal/MultiAgentEquationSolver/blob/master/input.txt).

# Input file description
First line = number of variables (n)
Followed by n lines mentioning the names of the variables
Next line = number of maximum iterations
Next line = error limit (iterations will stop when error equals to or below this number)
Followed by n lines, each line having n + 1 numbers (n coefficients and 1 intercept).
